 * \class IOConnections_MIMMO
 * \brief IOConnections_MIMMO is a class to read/write mimmo pin connections from XML IO/parser defined in bitpit::Config.  
 * \ingroup core
 *
 * Read and write declared connections from/to an external input/output XML configuration file. Needs to be constructed
 * with an external map reporting a string with "name of the object in XML file" as key, and a "BaseManipulation pointer" 
 * of all the object instantiated and connectable as argument. Search the right couple of object to connect and connects 
 * them, in input mode, or write existing connections in output mode.
 * 
 * In the XML interface a connection between two executable blocks must be declared following the nomenclature:
 *   <tt> \n \< name of connection (must be unique)\> \n
 *               \<sender\> name of the sender \</sender\> \n
 *               \<senderPort\> type of the sender Port \</senderPort\> \n
 *               \<receiver\> name of the receiver \</receiver\> \n
 *               \<receiverPort\> name of the receiver Port \</receiverPort\> \n
 *           \</name of connection (must be unique)\> \n </tt>
 * 
 * Multiple connections are declared repeating this block format as many times as necessary
